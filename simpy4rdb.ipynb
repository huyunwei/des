    "## A Closer Look at the Machine Shop Model\n",
    "A few key obersavtions of this workshop:\n",
    " \n",
    "- All machines work independently of each other.\n",
    "- Machines have two processes: *working* and *break_machine*\n",
    "  * The machine will repeate *working* process loop, unless/until it is interrupted by *break_mahine*, and will return to *working* after the *break_machie* process is **processed**. So the machines will have **one and only one** of two processes active during the simulation.\n",
    "  * Downtime of the machines of each *interrupt* is the wait time at repairman + time to repair.\n",
    "- Repairman has two states/processes: *other_job* and *repair*\n",
    "  * Similar to the machine, it is setup to have **one and only one** of two processes active during the simulation. \n",
    "  \n",
    "It is very close to RBD simulation already, but we still need a few tweaks.\n",
    "- Tyically with RBD we are more concerned with up/down time, so we can modify the *done_in* loop is used generate parts count, and keep log of up time, we don't need to loop-counter. We just need to log the start to interrupt.\n",
    "- All machines are independent and stand-alone, there is no \"system\". The *repairmen* is required for any failures, and his is working on *other_jobs* unless there is a component failure. We can use the *other_jobs* to track the component states, and generate system states. Again, the *other_job* is not a typical concern in reliability/availability calculation. We just need to track all the time to repair. In a series system, that is the system downtime.\n",
    "- All machies are stand-alone, and this means the system downtime does not stop the component. It is not always true. In a RBD simulation, some blocks will be brought offline by system downtime. This can be implemented by an interruption generated by *repairman*.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Changes to the Machine Shop Example\n",
    "- The machines class will need the following:\n",
    "  * attributes: ID/SN, Name/Description\n",
    "  * attribute: uptime, number of failures, and downtime\n",
    "  * attribute: time to failure (distribution or fixed)\n",
    "  * attribute: time to repair (distribution or fixed)\n",
    "  * process: working, handle interruption (req repairman, generation time_to_failure)\n",
    "  * process: break_machine: Time to failure (distribution parameter, use exponential for the fist prototype.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Time to repair (fixed or distribution parameter. Use fixed for the first prototype.)"
